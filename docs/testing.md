# Testing

Awash includes lightweight headless test and deterministic playtest runners.

## Run

```bash
./scripts/quality/test.sh
./scripts/quality/playtest.sh
```

## Current Coverage

- The Player controller follows each Movement and States rule in `docs/specs/player-spec.md` (`tests/player_controller_tests.gd`).
- The Player rig follows each Animation rule, and its table is complete: a row for every state and one sword offset per sword frame (`tests/player_rig_tests.gd`).
- The player scene wires the rig: its sprites follow controller state and facing, driven through the body's `controller`.
- The integrated main scene loads with its player, world, and pause menu.
- Runtime state defaults remain valid.
- The deterministic main-scene spawn remains stable.

## File Ownership

- `scripts/core/input_setup.gd` owns input action setup and default bindings.
- `scripts/player/player_controller.gd` owns player state transitions, facing, and horizontal movement.
- `scripts/player/player_rig.gd` owns the Player's sprite frames, animations, sword visibility and placement.
- `scripts/player/player.gd` owns input reading, gravity and collision movement.
- `scenes/player/player.tscn` owns the player node structure and collision shape.
